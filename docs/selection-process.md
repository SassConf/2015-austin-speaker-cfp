## Selection Process

**Submissions are closed.** 

Despite activity on your submission, no talk is accepted until a confirmation email is received. We will respond to everyone who submits a proposal, even if your presentation is not selected.

After submissions close, the Speaker team will review and select submissions. We aim for you to have 3-4 months advance notice.

_We'll be posting more details about the speaker selection process and selection teams soon!_
