## Code of Conduct

The Sass community is incredibly diverse, and we are committed to keeping it that way. We want to make an event that everyone loves to attend, participate in, and be inspired by.

**Everyone who participates in our conference agrees to abide by the CoC.** The SassConf team will absolutely enforce it and take all concerns or reports seriously. This extends to everyone: speakers, staff, sponsors, attendees, and even friends, at conference and workshop events, as well as conference-related social events.

If you donâ€™t know why a CoC is important, have questions or concerns about our CoC, or just want to talk about it, please email the SassConf team at [info@sassconf.com](mailto:info@sassconf.com).

> SassConf is dedicated and committed to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Sexual and discriminating language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.
