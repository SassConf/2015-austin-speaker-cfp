## What to Submit

Because this is *Sass*Conf, we’d like our talks to heavily feature, you guessed it, Sass. That said, there’s a lot of overlap with other languages and parts of front-end development, and we’d love to hear some creative new things!

We’d love to hear about:

* a technical demo of something crazy you built with Sass
* how you’re architecting your code
* a deep dive on a Sass feature
* the Sass and dev community, diversity, or local events
* how to work with a large dev team 
* using Sass for theming, internationalization, etc

We would prefer you not submit:

* vendor or framework overviews or how-tos
* pitches about your new tool

If you’re submitting about popular topics (such as style guides or grid systems), that’s great too, but we’d love it if you have a unique angle. While there are many excellent talks and a lot to say about these topics, we don’t want to inundate our attendees with the same information over and over all day.

We want to provide our attendees with awesome content and get them inspired. Because of this, we _prefer_ presentations that have not been given previously and/or aren’t recorded/available online. We’d rather hear your new ideas, let new speakers take the stage, and give attendees the coolest SassConf experience they can have.
