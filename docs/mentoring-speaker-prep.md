## Mentoring & Speaker Prep

This year we are putting a lot of focus on Speaker mentoring and preparation. We aim to have a quality event with unique and interesting talks, but we know that doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Not everyone is a natural public speaker, or knows how to make a great coding exercise, or maybe you aren’t sure what to speak about. That’s OK.

While the CFP is open, the Speaker team and Mentors will be happy to help you in any way to get your talk submitted. They will be available for office hours  to help you figure out what you can speak about; answer any questions about your ideas or speaking; put you in touch with speaking coaches or local events to practice your talk. Don't hesitate to get in touch!

_We'll post more details about office hours soon and mentors contact information soon._
 
Before the conference, selected speakers will have regular check-ins to review their materials and do prep work with the Speaker team and Mentors.
