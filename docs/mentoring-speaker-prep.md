## Mentoring & Speaker Prep

This year we are putting a lot of focus on Speaker mentoring and preparation. We aim to have a quality event with unique and interesting talks, but we know that doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Not everyone is a natural public speaker, or knows how to make a great coding exercise, or maybe you aren’t sure what to speak about. That’s OK.

While the CFP is open, the CFP Mentor Team will be happy to help you in any way to get your talk submitted. They will be available for office hours  to help you figure out what you can speak about; answer any questions about your ideas or speaking; put you in touch with speaking coaches or local events to practice your talk.

They’ll be available for office hours in 30 min blocks. They’ll also be occasionally perusing the submissions and may ask questions or chat with you on there, so don’t be surprised if you see them commenting!

### How do I sign up?

You can [request SassConf CFP Mentor Office Hours right here in this form](https://docs.google.com/a/sassconf.com/forms/d/1Goc82y1GE0lh_4Pgr0XaYnuIOBWRNPUw9qikWJihTJk/viewform)! You can request a particular person, or a CFP mentor of a particular gender, or anyone. Name and email are required so we can get in touch with you!

Once you request office hours, Scott or Elyse will schedule you with a mentor, taking into consideration your preferred mentor option, and everyone’s available time slots. You’ll get a scheduled session as soon as we verify with the mentor, and we’ll share contact info both ways.


### IRC Chat

We’re also excited to host an IRC chat specifically for SassConf and CFP related questions! You can access it [right here](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/?nick=user|?#sassconf) or by going to the **CFP Chat & Mentoring** link in the nav bar.

Scott and Elyse will be in the chat regularly, and the other mentors will be in occasionally as well!
