## Thanks!

We owe some special thanks to the following groups and people for helping us improve our CFP.

**CascadiaJS** and **JSConf/JSFest** for many great concepts around the CFP, including speaker prep and mentoring, suggested topics, talk encouragement links, and the submission template. We appreciate the transparency and openness of your CFP process and hope to do the same.

**CSSConfOakland** and **Karolina Szczur** for turning us on to the idea of open GitHub submissions and your dedication to speaker outreach and diversity. You inspire us so much!

Dan Denney at FrontEndConf, for your humble attitude, willingness to discuss and share ideas around organizing community conferences, and your amazing treatment of speakers. We hope to follow in your footsteps.

**All of our past speakers and upcoming speakers,** if you didn't submit talks and work so hard on them, we wouldn't be able to put on this amazing event. Thank you!
