# Video & Photo Policy

If you consent to your talk being recorded and/or photographed, your talk will be published on the internet for free along with captioning/transcripts, your slides or other materials, tweets about your talk, photos, and blog posts people may have written about it. 

We do not disable comments on the SassConf videos, but can upon request.

We promise to present you and your talk in a positive light so you can share your talk with friends, colleagues, and other event organizers you submit talks to. You're welcome to embed the video on your site. 

You retain all rights to your slides and materials. 

We explicitly ask for permission for SassConf to record or photograph you separately from asking on behalf of attendees.

We are happy to honor and enforce your wishes.

_Our adoption of a Video/Photo release is inspired by the phenomenal work of 
[Ashe Dryden](http://www.alterconf.com/speakers/ashe-dryden) notably [AlterConf](http://www.alterconf.com/)._
