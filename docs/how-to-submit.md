## How to Submit

This year we are submitting talks in the open on GitHub! We like this format because it:

* helps us keep better track of all the submissions,
* allows us to comment and discuss submissions with you,
* allows the community to chime in if they’re excited about a talk,
* and your submissions are editable! 

_If you are uncomfortable with submitting your talk publicly for _any reason_, you can always email your submission to [info@sassconf.com](mailto:info@sassconf.com). instead. All the other instructions remain the same!_

#### Steps to Submit

1. [Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don’t have one already.
2. Copy the [Submission Template](https://github.com/SassConf/2015-speaker-cfp/blob/master/docs/submission-template.md).
3. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/SassConf/2015-speaker-cfp/issues/new)) in our CFP repository.
4. Paste in the template and fill it out.
5. Submit your proposal!

Remember, because we’re on GitHub, submissions are editable. Typos? Want to change your outline? Have other bonus materials to add, like photos, slides, or code? Come back and add more until submissions close.

#### What’s Required?

The following items are _required_ for your submission to be considered:

* Your Name
* Your location (for budgeting purposes)
* At least one way to contact you
* Presentation title
* Presentation description

_If you don’t feel comfortable sharing your name, location, or contact information, please write “N/A” for that item and then email us directly at [info@sassconf.com](mailto:info@sassconf.com) with the information and a link to your submission issue._

#### What’s Preferred?

We’d love to have a short bio, a photo of you, or any other details like your blog, Twitter, or anything else.

If you are accepted, a bio and photo will be required.

#### Labels

Once you submit your new issue, there are quite a few labels available for your submission. You don't have to add any, but don't be surprised if we add some to your submission!

`talk` for standard length talk submissions

`lightning-talk` for lightning talk submissions

`workshop` for workshop submissions

`discussion` for moderated discussion submissions

`constructive-crit` if you want constructive criticism or feedback on your submission, add this label

`accepted` we will add this label once a talk is officially accepted
