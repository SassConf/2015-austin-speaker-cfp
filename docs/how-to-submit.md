## How to Submit

This year we are submitting talks in the open on GitHub! We like this format because it:

* helps us keep better track of all the submissions,
* you can see what else has been submitted to get ideas,
* allows us to comment and discuss submissions with you,
* allows the community to chime in if they’re excited about a talk,
* and your submissions are editable! 

We love open submissions because you can check out the submissions and see what's there! Feel free to take a look around before submitting your own! Even if you’re not submitting a talk, we'd love it if you'd read through submissions and :+1: the ones you’d be interested in! (_More about community interaction [here](https://github.com/SassConf/2015-speaker-cfp/blob/master/docs/how-to-submit.md#the-community-can-chime-in)._)

_If you are uncomfortable with submitting your talk publicly for **any reason**, you can always email your submission to [info@sassconf.com](mailto:info@sassconf.com). instead. All the other instructions remain the same!_

#### Steps to Submit

1. [Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don’t have one already.
2. Copy the [Submission Template](https://github.com/SassConf/2015-speaker-cfp/blob/master/docs/submission-template.md).
3. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/SassConf/2015-speaker-cfp/issues/new)) in our CFP repository.
4. Paste in the template and fill it out.
5. Submit your proposal!

Remember, because we’re on GitHub, submissions are editable. Typos? Want to change your outline? Have other bonus materials to add, like photos, slides, or code? Come back and add more until submissions close.

You're also more than welcome to submit multiple presentations!

#### What’s Required?

The following items are _required_ for your submission to be considered:

* Your Name
* Your location (for budgeting purposes)
* At least one way to contact you
* Presentation title
* Presentation description

_If you don’t feel comfortable sharing your name, location, or contact information, please write “N/A” for that item and then email us directly at [info@sassconf.com](mailto:info@sassconf.com) with the information and a link to your submission issue._

* * * 


#### What’s Preferred?

We’d love to have a short bio, a photo of you, or any other details like your blog, Twitter, or anything else.

If you are accepted and have consented to our [video/photo policy](https://github.com/SassConf/2015-speaker-cfp/blob/master/docs/video-photo-policy.md), a bio and photo will be required for use on the website.

#### Labels

Once you submit your new issue, there are quite a few labels available for your submission. You don't have to add any, but don't be surprised if we add some to your submission!

* `talk` for standard length talk submissions
* `lightning-talk` for lightning talk submissions
* `workshop` for workshop submissions
* `discussion` for moderated discussion submissions
* `constructive-crit` if you want constructive criticism or feedback on your submission, add this label

* * * 

##### "the community can chime in"!?

One of the cool things about doing an open CFP is that attendees who are _not_ submitting talks can comment on submissions. We want to select talks that attendees want to see, so if you're an attendee and see a talk you are excited about or have a question about, feel free to comment with a :+1: or question. 

That said, we'd like to keep this a comfortable environment for submitting speakers. It's nervewracking to put your work out there, so please avoid unsolicited criticism, negative comments, or any kind of drama. The comments _will_ be moderated for anything that violates our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SassConf/2015-speaker-cfp/blob/master/docs/code-of-conduct.md) will be deleted.
