## Description

[A description of your presentation goes here. Please don't give us a 140 character elevator pitch—tell us what you want to talk about. Give us an outline. Bullet points. A long rambly description of an idea. Tell us your dreams.

Fine Print:

* If you're selected, we'll help you write up an Official Description that can go on the website, so don't worry about that.
* Please don’t say, “I know it’s not that good/been done before/is a half baked idea!” You’re great and so is your submission!
* Here is where you can include any bonus materials, if you have them. Having or not having bonus materials will _not_ affect your submission.

If you are submitting a Moderated Discussion, please write about the topic you want to discuss in your small group.]

### Workshops Only: Exercise

[If you are submitting a workshop, please write a few sentences about the type of coding exercise you’ll be having attendees work on during your workshop.]

### Moderated Discussions Only: Topic & Questions

[If you are suggesting a Moderated Discussion, please write a few questions about your topic that you’d like to ask your small group, or the types of questions you hope to get re: your topic.]

Bio:

I’m an example bio. I'm an ex-Air Force pilot superhero who possesses the powers of flight, super strength, invulnerability, and cosmic energy blasts. I love a good costume change and [a snarky one-liner](http://caroldanversspeaking.tumblr.com/).
