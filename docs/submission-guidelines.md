## Submission Guidelines

This year we are accepting the following types of submissions. 

* * * 

### Standard Talk

**40 minutes, with slides, no Q&A.**

These are your standard conference talks. In a talk this long, it’s important to tell a good story. Talk about the how, and the why; don’t just inundate us with code.

### Lightning Talks

**15 minutes, with or without slides, no Q&A.**

If you have an idea for a shorter talk, are a beginning speaker who wants to get some experience without diving in head first, or want to try an idea out before making a long talk, submit a lightning talk!

Last year’s lightning talks included Una Kravets talking about [how to build a local Sass community](http://una.github.io/sassconf-2014/), and Katie K [schooling us on color theory](https://rawgit.com/KatieK2/2014-sassconf/master/index.html). Both got an amazing reception from the attendees, so don’t think that it’s not as “cool” to submit a short talk!

### Workshops

**4 hour, large group technical deep dives.**

The definition of a workshop is “a meeting at which a group of people engage in _intensive discussion and activity_” so please keep in mind that a workshop _is not_ a very long talk. Workshops must have an interactive, coding portion or exercise, and include Q&A or group work time. The 4 hours also includes plenty of break time! You may co-submit workshops or submit individually.

### Moderated Discussions

**60 minute small group participatory conversations.**

This year we are bringing in a new concept based off the success of last year’s Unconference: Moderated Discussions. These will be small group (10-15 people) sessions where everyone is/can be participatory. As the moderator, you’ll lead a conversation around a certain topic, talk about attendees particular experiences on a technical detail, or ask questions to the group. _Discussions will also have a trained faciliator that is not part of the Sass community. More on this TBD._
