# SassConf 2015

_A conference for front-end developers and designers that love Sass and are passionate about building a better, more beautiful web._

## Call for Proposals

The original all-Sass-all-the-time conference is back in 2015, and we think this year will be better than ever! But we can’t do that alone: we need speakers of all experience levels and backgrounds to make SassConf amazing. **We invite *you* to submit a talk, lightning talk, workshop, or moderated discussion.**
