# SassConf 2015

_A conference for front-end developers and designers that love Sass and are passionate about building a better, more beautiful web._

## Call for Proposals

The original all-Sass-all-the-time conference is back in 2015, and we think this year will be better than ever! But we can’t do that alone: we need speakers of all experience levels and backgrounds to make SassConf amazing. **We invite *you* to submit a talk, lightning talk, workshop, or moderated discussion.** Check out the [Topics Requested] section for ideas, and the [Submission Guidelines] for more details.

You do not need to be an experienced speaker to submit. This year we’re doing more speaker prep and mentoring than ever before, and want to work with you to make the best presentation you can give. Whether you need to workshop a new idea or get over some first-timer nerves, the SassConf Speaker team is making it a priority to help you out. 

#### Deadline to Submit: May 20, 2015

The deadline to submit a proposal is *May 20th, 2015*. If it’s still May 20th where you are, you can still submit. You can edit your submission as much as you like up until the end of the day on May 20th.

#### Conference Details

##### Location & Date
SassConf will be held in **New York City** in Fall 2015. Exact dates and venue TBD.
##### Size
Past SassConfs have been approximately 150 attendees. It is a one-track conference, so all attendees will see your talk. Workshops are typically in the 50 person range.


## What to Submit

Because this is *Sass*Conf, we’d like our talks to heavily feature, you guessed it, Sass. That said, there’s a lot of overlap with other languages and parts of front-end development, and we’d love to hear some creative new things!

We’d love to hear about:

* a technical demo of something crazy you built with Sass
* how you’re architecting your code
* a deep dive on a Sass feature
* the Sass and dev community, diversity, or local events
* how to work with a large dev team 
* using Sass for theming, internationalization, etc

We would prefer you not submit:

* vendor or framework overviews or how-tos
* pitches about your new tool

If you’re submitting about popular topics (such as style guides or grid systems), that’s great too, but we’d love it if you have a unique angle. While there are many excellent talks and a lot to say about these topics, we don’t want to inundate our attendees with the same information over and over all day.

We want to provide our attendees with awesome content and get them inspired. Because of this, we _prefer_ presentations that have not been given previously and/or aren’t recorded/available online. We’d rather hear your new ideas, let new speakers take the stage, and give attendees the coolest SassConf experience they can have.

#### Questions or Need Help?

If you’re not sure about your presentation topic or want some help with it, you can:

* check out our [Mentoring and Speaker Prep] section,
* [email] a member of the Speaker team if you have private questions, or
* submit and tag your proposal as [constructive-crit] and the Speaker team will comment or get in touch.


## Submission Guidelines

This year we are accepting the following types of submissions. 

#### Standard Talk

**40 minutes, with slides, no Q&A.**

These are your standard conference talks. In a talk this long, it’s important to tell a good story. Talk about the how, and the why; don’t just inundate us with code.

#### Lightning Talks

**15 minutes, with or without slides, no Q&A.**

If you have an idea for a shorter talk, are a beginning speaker who wants to get some experience without diving in head first, or want to try an idea out before making a long talk, submit a lightning talk!

Last year’s lightning talks included [Una Kravets] talking about how to build a local Sass community, and [Katie K] schooling us on color theory. Both got an amazing reception from the attendees, so don’t think that it’s not as “cool” to submit a short talk!

#### Workshops

**4 hour, large group technical deep dives.**

The definition of a workshop is “a meeting at which a group of people engage in _intensive discussion and activity_” so please keep in mind that a workshop _is not_ a very long talk. Workshops must have an interactive, coding portion or exercise, and include Q&A or group work time. The 4 hours also includes plenty of break time! You may co-submit workshops or submit individually.

#### Moderated Discussions

**30 minute small group participatory conversations.**

This year we are bringing in a new concept based off the success of last year’s Unconference: Moderated Discussions. These will be small group (10-15 people) sessions where everyone is/can be participatory. As the moderator, you’ll lead a conversation around a certain topic, talk about attendees particular experiences on a technical detail, or ask questions to the group.




## How to Submit

This year we are submitting talks in the open on GitHub! We like this format because it:

* helps us keep better track of all the submissions,
* allows us to comment and discuss submissions with you,
* allows the community to chime in if they’re excited about a talk,
* and your submissions are editable! 

_If you are uncomfortable with submitting your talk publicly for _any reason_, you can always email your submission to [cfp@sassconf.com] instead. All the other instructions remain the same!_

## Mentoring & Speaker Prep

This year we are putting a lot of focus on Speaker mentoring and preparation. We aim to have a quality event with unique and interesting talks, but we know that doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Not everyone is a natural public speaker, or knows how to make a great coding exercise, or maybe you aren’t sure what to speak about. That’s OK.

During the CFP, the Speaker Team will be happy to help you brainstorm to figure out what you can speak about, answer any questions you may have, and put you in touch with speaking mentors, local events to practice your talk at, or anything else you need.

Once speakers are selected, we will also have a Review team dedicated to helping them prepare for their talks. Speakers will have regular check-ins with the Review team.

**More information and details about mentoring and speaker prep TBD.**

If you need more encouragement or some material on submitting a good proposal, check out these awesome resources:

- Tiffany Conroy, [We Are All Awesome](http://weareallaweso.me/)
- Raquel Velez,  [Is Your Conference Proposal Good Enough?](http://rckbt.me/2014/01/conference-proposals/)
- Chris Williams, [An Addendum About Conference Proposals](http://blog.voodootikigod.com/an-addendum-about-conference-proposals/)
- Zach Holman, [speaking.io](http://speaking.io/plan/writing-a-cfp/)


## Selection Process

**Submissions close May 20th.** Up until then, you may edit your submission, ask the Speaker team questions, or provide extra materials. The Speaker team may comment and ask questions on your submission, or want to follow up for more information.

Despite activity on your submission, no talk is accepted until a confirmation email is received. We will respond to everyone who submits a proposal, even if your presentation is not selected.

After submissions close, the Speaker team will review and select submissions. We aim for you to have 3-4 months advance notice.






## Speaker Benefits

We know it takes a lot of work to submit, write, and give a talk, not to mention traveling, being away from work and family, and the crazy, late-night all-day intensity of conferences. We’re speakers too—we get it— so we want to make SassConf the best experience possible for our lovely speakers.

**SassConf will cover our speakers lodging, travel/airfare, and travel to and from the airport. It also includes all conference events. More details on this will be provided to selected speakers.**

_If you have concerns about travel or the cost of attending SassConf, such as disability accommodations, family travel, or anything else, please email us. We’ll do our best to help you out._



## Code of Conduct

The Sass community is incredibly diverse, and we are committed to keeping it that way. We want to make an event that everyone loves to attend, participate in, and be inspired by.

**Everyone who participates in our conference agrees to abide by the CoC.** The SassConf team will absolutely enforce it and take all concerns or reports seriously. This extends to everyone: speakers, staff, sponsors, attendees, and even friends, at conference and workshop events, as well as conference-related social events.

If you don’t know why a CoC is important, have questions or concerns about our CoC, or just want to talk about it, please email the [SassConf team email].

> SassConf is dedicated and committed to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Sexual and discriminating language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.
