## Speaker Benefits

We know it takes a lot of work to submit, write, and give a talk, not to mention traveling, being away from work and family, and the crazy, late-night all-day intensity of conferences. We’re speakers too—we get it— so we want to make SassConf the best experience possible for our lovely speakers.

**SassConf will cover our speakers lodging, travel/airfare, and travel to and from the airport. It also includes all conference events. More details on this will be provided to selected speakers.**

_If you have concerns about travel or the cost of attending SassConf, such as disability accommodations, family travel, or anything else, please email us. We’ll do our best to help you out._
