## Mentoring & Speaker Prep

This year we are putting a lot of focus on Speaker mentoring and preparation. We aim to have a quality event with unique and interesting talks, but we know that doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Not everyone is a natural public speaker, or knows how to make a great coding exercise, or maybe you aren’t sure what to speak about. That’s OK.

During the CFP, the Speaker Team will be happy to help you brainstorm to figure out what you can speak about, answer any questions you may have, and put you in touch with speaking mentors, local events to practice your talk at, or anything else you need.

Once speakers are selected, we will also have a Review team dedicated to helping them prepare for their talks. Speakers will have regular check-ins with the Review team.

_More information and details about mentoring and speaker prep TBD._
